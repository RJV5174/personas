# Personas

This is a repository of personas. The concept is to create reusable bunch of personas that can be used over and over again by different groups in the library (and perhaps outside). They are typically used in User Stories to provide more concrete user scenarios, although many people write user stories without them. They can also be used in other contexts as well, where it is helpful to have defined users.

## Use

To use them, just link to them, copy and paste, or what ever works best. I've made them CC-0 so that there are no issues with re-use. 

## Contributing

Feel free to add personas. Just try to avoid duplication. There are no hard and fast rules, but there are best practices. Here are a few.

  * Base them on real people.
    * Do research as required
    * They can and probably should be composites
  * Do not use real peoples names
    * I use a random name generator. 
    * A list of names is in the files. If you use that, remove the name you used.
  * Pictures help some people 
    * [User Interfaces](http://uifaces.com/) supplies pics that people have releaesd for this use.
  * Provide enough detail to make the persona useful
    * This will vary with purpose
    * The detail should help guide development of a service or feature
    * Some people like more fluff than others (i.e. how they enjoy work might be good, how often they walk their dog is too much?)
  * Given that these are for general use, some detail may be more important for you than others.
  
If you want to edit a persona do so judiciously, but really the goal is to make this a community project.

If you are unsure, submit a pull request (ask me Rob Olendorf, to help if you want).

There may be need to cull, or edit personas. Please don't take this personally.
